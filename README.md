# About
This page is for documentation and information on the ASRock/AMD BC-250, and about running it as a general purpose PC. These are compute units sold in a 4u rackmount chassis for the purpose of crypto mining. Thankfully everyone who bought these for that purpose lost a lot of money and is selling them off for cheap!

# Hardware info
- Features an AMD BC250 APU, codenamed 'Ariel', a cut-down variant of the APU in the PS5. It integrates 6x Zen 2 cores, at up to 3.49GHz (ish), as well as a 24CU RDNA2 iGPU (Codename 'cyan-skillfish'), as opposed to the 36 available in a standard PS5 Ariel SoC
- 1x M.2 2280 slot with support for NVMe (PCIe 2.0 x2) and SATA 3
- 1x DisplayPort, 1x GbE Ethernet, 2x USB 2.0, 2x USB 3.0
- 1x SPI header, 1x auto-start jumper, 1x clear CMOS jumper, 5x fans (non-standard connector), 1x TPM header
- NCT6686 SuperIO chip
- 220W TDP, so make sure you have a good quality power supply with PCIe 8-pin connectors available and a plan for cooling it. You can, in a pinch, get away with directly placing two 120mm fans directly on top of the heatsink. If you are doing custom cooling, don't forget the memory!!! Its GDDR6 it runs really hot!!!!

## Hardware Details

Further connector pinouts and a detailed listing of chip ID can be found on the [hardware page](./hardware.md).

### Power

`J1000` is a standard 8-pin 12V PCIe power connector and is sufficient

`J2000` and `J2001` are compatible with 8-pin Molex Micro-Fit connectors and are pinned as below:

```
   v                     v
[ LED1 12V 12V 12V ]  [ 12V 12V 12V GND ]
[ LED2 GND GND GND ]  [ GND GND GND PGD ]
```

For more detail on the non-power pins, check [their section of the hardware page](./hardware.md#j2000-and-j2001).

### Fans

`CPU_FAN1` is a normal 4-pin PWM-capable fan header. `J4003` exposes `CPU_FAN1` as `F1*` and provides four additional PWM fan control signals as follows, though no power is provided from this connector.

```
[ GND F1T F2T F3T F4T F5T DET     ]
[ GND F1P F2P F3P F4P F5P GND GND ]
   ^
```

The `F*T` pins are the tachometer outputs from each respective fan, and the `F*P` pins are the PWM outputs that can be sued to control their speeds. Note that the `F1*` pins are electically connected to `CPU_FAN1`.

# Memory
- 16GB GDDR6 shared between the GPU and CPU. By default, this will be set to either 8GB/8GB (CPU/GPU) or 4GB/12GB, depending on your firmware revision, and requires flashing modified firmware to change. 
- I've seen people mention using Smokeless_UMAF to try and expose these settings; Don't try it, you may cause permanent damage.
- If you are using these boards for gaming, make sure that you set the VRAM allocation to 512MB for the best experience (After flashing firmware).

# OS Support
- Linux:
  - Works reasonably well with most hardware functional. Fedora is recommended, however it would be simple to get literally any distro running.
  - Flatpak applications will NOT* work correctly until they pull in Mesa 25.1. Don't try and run Bazzite just yet.
  - In theory, a Fedora rawhide image should boot with nothing but the kernel commandline options listed below.
- Windows:
  - No
  - It will boot, but the GPU is not supported by any drivers and is unlikely to ever be. Everything else seems to work alright, so I guess if you've been kicked in the head recently you could use it for non-GPU focused workloads.
- MacOS:
  - Next person to ask this will be asked to find out if the PCIe bracket counts as a flared base.
  
# Making it work
## Mesa
- Upstream support [landed](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/33116) in Mesa 25.1. If your distro ships this new of a version, or if it has a ``mesa-git`` equivalency, you should be able use them without modification. 
- You must set ``RADV_DEBUG=nocompute`` in ``/etc/environment`` to resolve issues with Vulkan visual issues.
- Some OpenGL workloads cause a GPU hang still, and most compute loads will trigger a GPU reset when the compute instance is closed. This would normally be fine, but it is unrecoverable on these boards.
- Flatpak applications will fail to run due to the bundled mesa not having the required patches. You can temporarily work around this by setting ``FLATPAK_GL_DRIVERS=mesa-git``.
- If your distro doesn't ship a new enough Mesa, either:
  - Rebuild Mesa manually with this [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mothenjoyer69/bc250-documentation/refs/heads/main/BC250-mesa.patch) patch.
  - Alternatively, patched Mesa builds are available via copr, [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/exotic-soc/bc250-mesa/).
- You may also need to set ``ttm.pages_limit=3959290`` and ``ttm.page_pool_size=3959290`` as kernel options to access more than 8GB of the shared memory. Thanks Magnap :)
   
## Kernel
- You may need to add ``nomodeset`` to the kernel command line prior to installing the correct mesa version. Don't forget to remove this once they are installed.
- Kernels older than 6.11ish may need ``amdgpu.sg_display=0`` to be set.

## Simple setup script
- This script is designed for Fedora 40+ and should set up everything needed properly, except for flashing the modified firmware. Run at your own risk.
  - ``curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mothenjoyer69/bc250-documentation/refs/heads/main/fedora-setup.sh | sh``

# Advanced
## Modified firmware
## ***ANY DAMAGE OR ISSUES CAUSED BY FLASHING THIS MODIFIED IMAGE IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY ENTIRELY***
- A modified firmware image is available at [this repo](https://gitlab.com/TuxThePenguin0/bc250-bios/) (Credit and massive thanks to [Segfault](https://github.com/TuxThePenguin0)). He is responsible for most of the information on running these boards. Say thank you.
- Flashing via a hardware programmer is recommended. Get yourself a CH347, or a Raspberry Pi Pico, or anything else capable of recovering from a bad BIOS flash.
- ***DO NOT FLASH ANYTHING WITHOUT HAVING A KNOWN GOOD BACKUP***
  - SPI flash header pinout:
    ```
      [ GND SCLK MOSI    ]
      [ VCC  CS  MISO  ? ]
         ^
      ```
- VRAM allocation is configured within: ``Chipset -> GFX Configuration -> GFX Configuration``. Set ``Integrated Graphics Controller`` to forced, and ``UMA Mode`` to  ``UMA_SPECIFIED``, and set the VRAM limit to your desired size. 512MB appears to be the best for general APU use. You will have a worse experience overall with a 4/12 split, outside of specific circumstances. Credit to [Segfault](https://github.com/TuxThePenguin0)
- Many of the newly exposed settings are untested, and could either do nothing, or completely obliterate you and everyone else within a 100km radius. Or maybe they work fine. Be careful, though.
     - There are a number of firmware images floating around with "everything unlocked!". Be very, very cautious of using these.
- Note: If your board shipped with P4.00G (or any other BIOS revision that modified the memory split) you may need to fully clear the firmware settings as it can apparently get a little stuck. Removing the coin cell and using the CLR_CMOS header should suffice.        

## NCT6686 SuperIO
- In order for ``lm-sensors`` to recognize the chip (ID ``0xd441``), you must load the nct6683 driver. You can so via ``modprobe nct6683 force=true`` or by adding ``options nct6683 force=true`` to ``/etc/modprobe.d/sensors.conf``, and ``nct6683``to ``/etc/modules-load.d/99-sensors.conf`` and regenerate your initramfs.
- Once enabled you should see a bunch more sensor data reported, including important temps :)
- Massive thanks to [yeyus](https://github.com/yeyus) for [this info](https://github.com/mothenjoyer69/bc250-documentation/issues/3).

## Performance
- A GPU governor is available [here](https://gitlab.com/mothenjoyer69/oberon-governor). You should use it. Values are set in /etc/oberon-config.yaml. The defaults should be fine, but you can bump them up if you are experiencing instability (or want a nice space heater)
  - You can also use the following commands to set the clocks manually:
    ```
    echo vc 0 <CLOCK> <VOLTAGE> > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.1/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage
    echo c > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:08.1/0000:01:00.0/pp_od_clk_voltage
    ```

# Additional notes:
- I have repeatedly recieved requests for help from people who have not read through this page correctly. Please do not purchase these boards if any part of this page is confusing. These are not, and will not ever be, standard desktop boards, and expecting them to be is a stupid thing to do.
- I have seen an alarming number of people I have personally helped out attempt to claim the information uncovered by Segfault as their own. You all suck, credit people properly. Many of these people also seem to fall under the above note.
- God XDA sucks
- Please don't make issues asking for help with anything *but* these boards.
- A discord server exists [here](https://discord.gg/uDvkhNpxRQ). This is a community of people running and pushing the limits of these boards. Feel free to say hi.
